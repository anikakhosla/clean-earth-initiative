    <h2>What is Plastic Pollution?</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic pollution is when plastic waste ends up in nature — in oceans, rivers, parks, and streets. 
      Since plastic takes hundreds of years to break down, it keeps building up and harming animals, people, and the planet.
    </p>
    <div class="important">
      🌍 Did you know? Over <b>8 million tons</b> of plastic end up in the oceans every year!
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="problems">
    <h2>Why is Plastic a Problem?</h2>
    <p>
      Plastic pollution causes a lot of harm. Animals like turtles and birds eat plastic by mistake, thinking it’s food. 
      This can make them very sick or even kill them. Plastic can also block drains and cause flooding. 
      And tiny plastic pieces called <b>microplastics</b> are even found in our food and water!
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="solutions">
    <h2>What Can We Do?</h2>
    <p>
      There are many smart ways to reduce plastic pollution. Here are some:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use reusable water bottles and bags 👜</li>
      <li>Avoid plastic straws and cutlery 🥤</li>
      <li>Recycle properly ♻️</li>
      <li>Join or organize clean-up events 🌿</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="help">
    <h2>How Can Students Help?</h2>
    <p>
      Students like us can make a big difference! Here’s how:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start a recycling club at school 🏫</li>
      <li>Make posters to spread awareness 🎨</li>
      <li>Give presentations in class or assemblies 📢</li>
      <li>Write to local leaders to ask for better recycling bins 📝</li>
    </ul>
